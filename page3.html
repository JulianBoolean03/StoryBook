      <h2>The House That Learned My Name — III</h2>
      <p>The key swung like a pendulum, ticking time I didn’t have. The hand didn’t beckon; it waited, patient as rot.
        When I stepped closer, the air thinned to a thread. I could hear the house choosing which boards would hold me
        and which would let me fall.</p>
      <p>“Don’t touch it,” my mother’s voice said from somewhere deep in the ductwork, thinner now, stretched over
        distance that didn’t exist last night. “It wants you to think it’s an invitation.”</p>
      <p>But the brass had my thumbprint in it already—like I’d held it once, long ago, in a room the house hadn’t built
        yet. The key turned on the tendon and the looped flesh squeaked like wet leather. The hand nudged it forward.
        Not offering. <em>Measuring.</em></p>
      <p>Behind me, the family photos changed frames—cheap black plastic swelling into carved wood, then into something
        with pores. The glass fogged from the inside again. New letters wrote themselves backward so I had to read them
        from the reflections in the microwave door:</p>
      <p><em>ASK IT WHAT IT WANTS.</em></p>
      <p>“What do you want?” I whispered to the crack. My voice came back wrong—older, tired, as if I’d been practicing
        for years. The chain inside the door lifted and settled, like a sleeper turning over.</p>
      <p>“A name,” the house said, but it wasn’t my mother anymore. It was the sub-basement voice, the wet one, vowels
        stuffed with cloth. “Yours will do.”</p>

      <p>“You can’t have mine,” I said, but it sounded polite, the way you decline a second slice of cake at a funeral.
        The key swung again, faster, and each pass shaved a filament of heat off the air until my breath smoked.</p>
      <p>“Then bring another,” the not-mother murmured from the door. “A neighbor. A friend. A small one if you have it.
        Houses grow on little names first.” The hand flexed. Nails lifted and fell like thin-bladed knives.</p>
      <p>Something moved in the vents—too heavy for dust, too soft for metal. It dragged itself toward the register by
        the floor and pressed there until the grate bowed. A film of condensation gathered on the slats and ran into
        letters that spelled my childhood nickname, the one no one alive uses anymore.</p>
      <p>“Mom,” I said, and the register ticked as if clearing its throat. “If that’s you—tell me something only you
        would know.”</p>
      <p>The answer came at once, sweet and clean as dish soap and winter sun. “You hid your report card in the freezer
        behind the peas. I thawed it and signed it anyway.”</p>
      <p>Relief cracked me open—and the basement door widened with it, exploiting the gap. The hand slid farther, wrist
        following, skin the color of damp paper, veins rising like blue writing beneath a lamp. The key kissed the floor
        with a chiming sound that didn’t echo in this house; it multiplied.</p>
      <p>“Don’t smile,” my mother said sharply. “It eats that.”</p>
      <p>I knelt anyway. The key was heavier than brass should be. It left a crescent of cold in my palm that fit me
        perfectly.</p>
