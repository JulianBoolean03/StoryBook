      <h2>The House That Learned My Name</h2>
      <p>The first knock came at 3:11 a.m.—three soft taps that rattled the glass as if a pulse lived in the wood. I
        stared at the door until the knocking stopped. When silence finally settled, I realized it wasn’t silence at
        all. The house was breathing—boards flexing, pipes exhaling, the vents whispering warm air that smelled like
        pennies and rain-soaked dirt.</p>
      <p>I told myself to sleep. Instead, I followed the smell down the hall, past family photos that had tilted
        themselves downward, faces angled as if trying to watch the floor. The carpet was damp. Each step pressed a dark
        oval that filled with moisture and then vanished, as if the fibers were drinking my footprint.</p>
      <p>In the kitchen, the fridge hummed on a note too low to hear and too heavy to ignore. The hum matched my heart.
        The window above the sink had fogged from the inside; a fingertip had traced a single word through the clouded
        pane:</p>
      <p><em>LISTEN.</em></p>
      <p>I didn’t mean to obey, but I held my breath anyway. That’s when I heard a mouth moving somewhere behind the
        walls—wet, deliberate sounds, like someone tonguing a loose tooth. Then, very softly, the house spoke my name in
        a voice I knew: my mother’s, who had been buried six winters ago under a slab of clean stone and a line of dates
        that still felt like a misprint.</p>

      <p>“Go back to bed,” her voice said from the register below the cabinets, syllables pushed through dust and rust.
        “You’re making it worse.”</p>
      <p>The overhead light flickered and stayed dim, as if afraid to be seen. I crouched beside the vent. Cold air
        brushed my lips with the taste of clay and old coins. “Mom?” I asked. The word came out smaller than I meant,
        like I’d set a bigger word down somewhere and couldn’t lift it again.</p>
      <p>“Don’t open the basement,” she whispered. “It isn’t hungry for you yet.”</p>
      <p>Footsteps answered her from the stairs—slow, padded, wrong. Not weight on wood; wood <em>on</em> weight, as if
        the steps themselves were easing down the spine of something that crawled upright. The smell of pennies
        sharpened. A damp line crept from the basement door, pooling beneath the knob, seeping into the grain in the
        shape of a human ear.</p>
      <p>It pressed there, listening back.</p>
      <p>“If you stay very still,” my mother said from the vent, “it might mistake you for furniture.”</p>
      <p>The basement chain rasped once. Then the door sighed open a thumb’s width. In that thin slice of dark,
        something breathed me in—slow, appreciative—and breathed me out in a colder shape. The photos in the hall
        twisted on their hooks. Faces lengthened. Eyes turned to flat black pits. From the crack, a hand slid out,
        knuckles barked and raw, a small brass key threaded through its fingers on a tendon like a string.</p>
      <p>“Listen,” the house said again, and every nail in the walls shivered to attention.</p>
