      <h2>The House That Learned My Name — IV</h2>
      <p>The key pulsed once in my hand, a faint warm throb, as if it had a tiny heart learning my rhythm. The basement
        door watched me through its thumb-width crack. The ear-shaped stain along the grain had darkened, cartilage
        blooming where there had only been damp wood.</p>
      <p>“Don’t use it,” my mother warned from the vent, voice thinner than thread. “It fits more than locks.”</p>
      <p>“Then what does it open?” I asked.</p>
      <p>“You,” said the not-mother, bright with satisfaction. The chain lifted and set down again, the sound of a
        tongue finding a new tooth.</p>
      <p>I looked at the key’s bit—teeth worn smooth by a mouth, not a door. I turned it in my palm and a soft clicking
        answered inside my chest, like an old clock waking. The family photos shifted again; some frames now held empty
        wallpaper where faces should be. Others held me from angles I don’t remember standing in.</p>
      <p>On the floor, the damp spread into a circle, then another, as if cups had been set down for guests. In the
        circles, faint letters rose: <em>PLACE IT HERE.</em></p>
      <p>“There’s a different lock,” my mother said quickly. “Upstairs.”</p>
      <p>“There isn’t,” the house replied. “Upstairs is just my throat with steps.”</p>

      <p>I didn’t go up. I set the key in the nearest damp ring and the floor swallowed it to the bow, holding it
        upright like a flag pinned in wet sand. The house breathed in, long and pleased, and the spine of the place
        creaked as if it were stretching after a nap.</p>
      <p>Somewhere beyond the basement, a second front door opened—no hinges, just the sound of a welcome widening. Cold
        came out of it like a hand over a candle. The register rattled hard enough to spit dust.</p>
      <p>“If you walk away now,” my mother said, “it will have to follow you. It hates the cold. Let it starve.”</p>
      <p>“Houses don’t starve,” the not-mother said gently. “We weather. We wait.”</p>
      <p>I hooked my finger under the key’s ring and felt the whole room lean toward me, polite, attentive. I thought of
        names: mine, my father’s, the dog that only made it one summer. I thought of the nickname wetting the grate. I
        thought of the freezer behind the peas.</p>
      <p>“You can’t have my name,” I said again, and this time it wasn’t polite. The key cooled in agreement—or warning.
      </p>
      <p>“Trade, then,” the house suggested. “Give a name you don’t use anymore. I’ll keep it safe, and you can keep
        your door.”</p>
      <p>The photos on the wall all turned at once, frames aligning like soldiers. Every one of them showed me asleep.
      </p>
      <p>“Choose,” the house said, and the chain lifted a final inch.</p>
