      <h2>The House That Learned My Name — V</h2>
      <p>I didn’t pick a person. I picked a season. “Winter,” I said. “You can have that.”</p>
      <p>The house laughed the way nails do when they’ve been bent and straightened too many times. “Seasons don’t
        open,” it said.</p>
      <p>My hand found the key again—colder now, as if remembering instructions I hadn’t given. I stood, and the whole
        frame of the place leaned politely to keep me near the basement. Instead I turned for the kitchen, and the floor
        had to decide between following and letting go. It let go. Boards groaned like ropes burned through.</p>
      <p>At the freezer I shoved aside the peas and stacked meals and the frosted bag of blueberries that always smelled
        like July when I opened it. I set the key on the ice tray and the cold bit it with small white teeth.</p>
      <p>Behind me the chain fretted, metal chattering in a language of bad anticipation. “Don’t,” the not-mother
        whispered from the door, almost tender. “We’ll be alone down here. Don’t make it long.”</p>
      <p>“You said it hates the cold,” I told my mother, voice frosting the air. “How long does it take to starve?”</p>
      <p>“Houses don’t starve,” she said, and I could hear her smile for the first time in six winters. “But throats
        close.”</p>
      <p>I poured water over the key, filling the tray. The freezer light flickered and held. The key’s ring tilted,
        then stilled as ice found its balance. Inside the walls, something exhaled like a black lung emptying. The ear
        on the basement door paled to warped grain and then to nothing at all.</p>

      <p>Silence came back wrong: too smooth, like a floor that had been sanded to hide what it saw. The family photos
        relaxed on their hooks. Faces refilled themselves, not quite right, as if developed in a hurry. On the register,
        the condensation spelled nothing at all—just ran and dripped and froze in a thin rim of rime.</p>
      <p>“Go to bed,” my mother said softly from the vent, no scrape in it now, only breath. “Morning will make it
        smaller.”</p>
      <p>I waited beside the freezer with the door open until the tray turned clear. A brass shadow hung inside the ice
        like a trapped golden fishbone. When I shut the door, the house creaked once in complaint and then settled,
        wounded but living.</p>
      <p>At 3:11 a.m., I lay in the dark and listened for the knock. It came—three soft taps—but from the freezer this
        time. The sound was tiny, domestic, almost cute. A refrigerator heartbeat. I pulled the covers to my chin and
        let it count me.</p>
      <p>By the time the sun reached the sink, the smell of pennies had thinned to kitchen metal and dish soap. I pried
        the tray, cube by cube, into a bowl. Each cube clicked like a little tooth. I set them back behind the peas and
        shut the door quick, the way you close a mouth before it learns a word.</p>
      <p>In the hall, I straightened the photos and saw myself staring back from some angle I did remember—sleep-heavy,
        first-day-of-school hair wrong, my mother’s handwriting on a paper just out of frame. I whispered thanks toward
        the vent. The grate stayed quiet, but the warmth changed—less like breath, more like sunlight through old
        curtains.</p>
      <p>That night, no knocks. The next, just one. On the third, nothing at all. The house learned to say other things:
        settling, sighing, listening to rain.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, when I open the freezer, a thin frost writes across the bag of peas and fades. If I squint, I can
        make it out.</p>
      <p><em>LISTEN.</em></p>
      <p>I do. I listen to the quiet throat of the house, and to the small, patient tapping that lives inside winter,
        and I keep the door shut when I sleep.</p>
